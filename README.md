# GraphQL::Flamegraph

Collects data for visualizing performance of your GraphQL request resolving for applications built with [GraphQL-Ruby].

## Installation

 1. Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    ```ruby
    gem 'graphql-flamegraph'
    ```

    And then execute:

    ```shell script
    $ bundle install
    ```

 2. Plug it into your GraphQL schema:

    ```ruby
    class YourAppSchema < GraphQL::Schema
      use GraphQL::Flamegraph, path: Rails.root.join("tmp")
    end
    ```

## Usage

To generate flamegraph for some query, set `flamegraph` option to `true` in your context.

```ruby
result = YourAppSchema.execute(
  query: "query { products { id title quantity â€¦ } }",
  context: { flamegraph: true },
  variables: {},
)
```

Path to the generated file will be printed to standard output like this:

```
Check your flamegraph at /tmp/graphql-flamegraph-20200320-90923-px3494.txt
Open it in https://www.speedscope.app/ or in local speedscope:

    speedscope /tmp/graphql-flamegraph-20200320-90923-px3494.txt

```

Also you will be able to access collected data via `result.context[:flamegraph].to_s`

You can view it with your favorite flamegraph visualizer.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.
